# PATHWAY GENERATION

This repository contains the implementation of an PATHWAY GENERATION designed to interact with students, collect their responses, and securely process and analyze the data using differential privacy techniques.

## Architecture

## Overview

The Educational Counsellor Chatbot follows the below process flow:

1. **User Interaction**: The chatbot interacts with students, asking questions and collecting their responses.
2. **Data Collection**: The responses from students are collected for further processing.
3. **Secure Data Processing**: The collected data is sent to the backend, where the `dp-opt` component ensures that sensitive data is mixed with the remaining data to maintain privacy.
4. **Prompt Construction**: A secure prompt is created based on the processed data.
5. **Sending to Ollama**: The prompt is sent to the Ollama service, which forwards it to the required selected language model.
6. **Model Response**: The selected language model processes the prompt and sends the response back to the backend.
7. **Displaying the Output**: The backend sends the response to the frontend via FastAPI, and the chatbot displays the output to the user.

## Components

- **Chatbot**: Collects inputs from users and interacts with them.
- **Backend (Flask)**: Handles API requests, processes data using `dp-opt`, and constructs secure prompts.
- **Ollama**: Sends the constructed prompt to the selected language model and receives the response.
- **MODELS**: We Can use LLAMA2, LLAMA3, MISTRAL , Any models which are avialable in OLLAMA
- **Language Model (LLM)**: Processes the prompt and generates a response.
- **FastAPI**: Facilitates communication between the backend and the frontend.
- **Frontend**: Displays the output from the language model to the user.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
